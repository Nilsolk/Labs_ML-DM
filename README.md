This is a repository that stores laboratory work (5) in the discipline of Mathematical Logic and Discrete Mathematics
1. The First laboratory work is a program that performs operations with two sets: union, intersection, complement A\B B\A, symmetric difference.
2. The second laboratory work is a program that defines the properties of a relation: reflexivity, symmetry, skewness, transitivity.
3. The third laboratory work is a program that determines whether a relation is a function.
4. The fourth laboratory work was a program for finding the shortest path in a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.
5. The fifth laboratory work is a program for finding the reachability matrix.
